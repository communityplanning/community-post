Concept
Community Post is an interactive engagement platform designed to bridge the gap between residents and planners. It functions as a digital town hall where community members can propose, discuss, and vote on development ideas across various urban topics—from transit improvements to green space initiatives.
By integrating democratized feedback (likes/dislikes) with professional oversight (staff responses and priority setting), the application transforms raw community sentiment into an actionable, transparent roadmap. 

The Stack
Frontend & Design: Wix Studio (Responsive Engine). Utilizes a CSS-grid and repeaters cards layout for cross-device compatibility.
Development Framework: Velo by Wix. A "Full-stack" development environment that allows for custom JavaScript injection on both client and server sides.
Logic & Scripting: JavaScript (ES6+).
Frontend: Event handlers for real-time voting and dynamic filtering.
Backend: Velo Web Modules (.jsw) to ensure secure data handling and administrative overrides (Staff responses).
Database: Wix CMS (Collections). A NoSQL-style document database.
Security & Auth: Wix Members & Roles. Implements Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to differentiate between "Community Members" and "Planning Staff."
Third-Party Integration: Web Share API & Social platform integration for cross-channel engagement.
